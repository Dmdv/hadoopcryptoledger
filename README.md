# Hadoop Crypto Ledger (hadoopcryptoledger)
This repository will provide various components to read crypto ledgers, such as the Bitcoin blockchain, with Hadoop and Ecosystem components. More particularly, the current plans are to provide:
* a FileInputFormat for Hadoop to read crypto ledgers, such as the Bitcoin blockchain, with Hadoop applications.
* a Hive Serde to read transactions from crypto ledgers, such as the Bitcoin blockchain, with Hive by representing them as normal tables. These tables can then be joined with other tables containing other relevant information, such as stock market movements or weather patterns.
